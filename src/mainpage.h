/**
   @mainpage package pyLikelihood

   @author James Chiang <jchiang@slac.stanford.edu>

   Using <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> via the <a
   href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~jchiang/SwigPolicy/doxy-html/main.html">SwigPolicy</a>
   package, the C++ class library of Likelihood has been exposed to <a
   href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  These classes by
   themselves do not constitute a suitable interactive interface.
   However, armed with these classes and with a modest effort, the
   Python modules in this package provide a fairly simple interactive
   environment.
